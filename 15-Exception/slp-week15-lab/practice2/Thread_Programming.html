<h2>Thread Programming</h2>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>You can get the code you need for this part of the lab <a href="handout/threadedclient.zip">here</a>.  This archive contains the
following files:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>RemoteServer.lib</dt>
    <dd>The remote server library</dd>
  <dt>tclient.exe</dt>
    <dd>Your threaded client.  Initially, this is identical to sclient.exe.
	</dd>
  <dt>sclient.exe</dt>
    <dd>The sequential client;  just a compilation of the original
        code.  You will be comparing the performance of your threaded
	tclient.exe to this naive sequential solution.</dd>
  <dt>servers.h</dt>
    <dd>Public interface to the remote server library</dd>
  <dt>ThreadedClient.cpp</dt>
    <dd>The source file for the threaded client.  You will be
        modifying this file and handing it in.</dd>
  <dt>ThreadedClient.dsw</dt>
    <dd>The Visual C++ workspace for this project</dd>
  <dt>ThreadedClient.dsp</dt>
    <dd>The Visual C++ project file for this project</dd>
  <dt>ThreadedClient.ncb</dt>
    <dd>Visual C++ support file</dd>
  <dt>ThreadedClient.opt</dt>
    <dd>Visual C++ support file</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>In this part of the lab, you're going to use threads to parallelize the
operation of a very simple database client.  This program has a very simple
task:  you provide it an account number, and it prints out the personal
and account information of the client corresponding to that number.</p>

<p>The business for which you're writing this application has decided to
split the account information into two separate databases: one to
manage client's personal information (which is bulky, but mostly
constant), and one to manage the client's account information (which
is smaller, but changes a lot).  The job of the program is to contact
each database, access the information, and print it to the user.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the databases are slow, and your connection to them
isn't good.  It can, therefore, take awhile to contact each database,
so in order to make the program respond as quickly as possible, you
have decided to use threaded programming, so that separate threads
can contact the databases in parallel.</p>

<p>Your program should work as follows:</p>

<ol><li>The main thread retrieves the account number from the command
	line.</li>
    <li>The main thread creates two threads to access the
        databases and gives them the account number requested.</li>
    <li>The database threads contact the databases and get the
	results.  When they have the results, they pass them to
	the main thread and terminate.</li>
    <li>The main thread waits for the database threads to terminate,
	then prints out the results and terminates.</li>
</ol>

<p>When compiling this program, you may occasionally receive a linker warning 
  about conflicts with LIBC. You may safely ignore this warning.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An existing codebase exists which contacts each database
sequentially and retrieves information from them.  You should modify
this program to use threads, but otherwise leave it alone -- the
output should be in the same style, etc.</p>

<p>The code for contacting the databases is already written for you, in
the two functions <code>GetPersonalInformation()</code> and
<code>GetAccountInformation()</code>.  These functions simulate contacting
a real database server over a slow network connection.  Your worker
threads should simply call these functions.</p>

<p>To create a thread, use the <code>_beginthread()</code> Windows API
call:</p>

<p><code>unsigned long _beginthread( void (*startpoint)( void * ), unsigned int stacksize, void *arguments )</code></p>

<p>The first argument is a pointer to the function that Windows will call at the 
  beginning of the thread; when this function returns, the thread will terminate. 
  This function takes a <code>void *</code> as an argument, and "returns" <code>void</code>; 
  be sure to specify that it uses __cdecl calling conventions (see example). The 
  stack size you should provide is 0; Windows interprets this as a special case 
  meaning "inherit the stack size from the parent thread", which is fine for our 
  purposes. The third argument is the argument that will be provided to the thread's 
  main function. For example, if you declare:</p>

<code><pre>
 /* our thread's starting function; be sure to explicitly
    use __cdecl calling conventions */
 void __cdecl threadfunc( void *args ) {
    int *n = (int *) args;
    cout << "Received %d\n" << *n << endl;
}

int main( int argc, char **argv ) {
    HANDLE thread;
    int n = 7;
    thread = (HANDLE) _beginthread( threadfunc, 0, &n );
    if (thread == (HANDLE) -1L) {
	cerr << "Couldn't create thread!" << endl;
	exit(1);
    }else {
 	WaitForSingleObject( thread, INFINITE );
	cout << "Done!" << endl;
	exit(0);
    }
}
</pre></code>

<p><code>_beginthread</code> is prototyped to return an unsigned long.
In fact, this unsigned long is equivalent to a <b>handle</b>, which is
a Windows-specific abstraction.  A handle represents some sort of
operating-system object, like synchronization primitives and opened
files; in this case, it's a <b>thread handle</b>.  We can do all sorts
of interesting things to threads using a thread handle, but here we
just want to wait for the thread to end; we can achieve that using the
<code>WaitForSingleObject</code> call.  In the project, you'll want to
wait for any of several handles; this is done using the
<code>WaitForMultipleObjects</code> call:</p>

<p><code>DWORD WaitForMultipleObjects( DWORD count, CONST HANDLE *handles, BOOL wait_all, DWORD timeout )</code></p>

<p><code>handles</code> points to an array of handles that you're
interested in; the number of elements in the array must be (at least)
<code>count</code>.  If <code>wait_all</code> is <code>TRUE</code>,
then <code>WaitForMultipleObjects</code> will wait for all of the
handles to become signalled -- if they're thread handles, for all the
threads to terminate.  <code>timeout</code> specifies how long to
wait, in milliseconds; the special value <code>INFINITE</code> means
to wait for all the handles, no matter how long it takes.</p>

<p>You should always check your calls for completion.  In particular,
<code> _beginthread()</code> can return -1L to signal that it failed to
create a thread.  If you make any assumptions in your code, be sure
to state them clearly.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>You will be graded on this part of the assignment as follows:</p>

<ul><li>6 points for successfully and safely creating the threads.</li>
    <li>6 points for successfully waiting for those threads to complete.</li>
    <li>6 points for successfully passing information between the
        threads.</li>
    <li>6 points for style and documentation.</li></ul>
