<h3>Lab Requirements</h3>

<p>This lab assumes that you are using Visual C++ under a 32-bit version of Windows, 
  using Intel Pentium or Pentium-equivalent machines. The exact compiler and platform 
  are mostly unimportant, as the lab is reasonably portable, but the lab specifically 
  uses Pentium features. A list of compatible processors follows; if you don't 
  have access to such a machine, please talk to your instructor.</p>

<ul><li>Intel Pentium</li>
    <li>Intel Pentium Pro</li>
    <li>Intel Celeron</li>
    <li>Intel Pentium II</li>
    <li>Intel Pentium III</li>
    <li>Intel Pentium 4</li>
    <li>Intel Xeon</li>
    <li>AMD K6-2</li>
    <li>AMD K6-III</li>
    <li>AMD Athlon</li>
</ul>

<p>The specific criterion for compatibility is an IA-32 processor with the RDTSC 
  instruction; note that, in particular, the AMD K6 lacks this instruction, as 
  do all processors prior to the Pentium. If you aren't certain whether your processor 
  supports this instruction, the lab does include a function to check this, and 
  will do so automatically each time you run the <code><cite>Timestamp.exe</cite></code> 
  program. If your processor does not support the RDTSC instruction, you will 
  be notified with the message "processor does not support timestamp register". 
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You may find <a href="Exercise6/handout/notes.html">these notes</a> useful.</p>

<p>The hardware used in most computers today times internal functions in terms 
  of a hardware clock, not to be confused with the system clock. The system clock
  simply keeps track of the current time, while, without going 
  too in-depth, a hardware clock sends a regular electrical pulse along a wire, 
  allowing different pieces of hardware to coordinate their activities. In particular, 
  processors receive clock signals at a specific frequency and use these signal 
  to coordinate the execution of instructions. Higher frequencies translate to 
  faster execution. All processors have a maximum frequency at which they can 
  operate; exceeding this frequency can cause the processor to not work properly, 
  and sometimes can permanently damage the processor. Therefore, processors are rated 
  by their manufacturers to run at frequencies up to a certain limit; this limit 
  is the number often seen next to a processor's name. Thus, a 1.6GHz Pentium 
  4 processor is rated to safely receive 1.6 billion clock cycles per second. 
  Configuring a computer to exceed this amount (called overclocking) is 
  sometimes possible, but always dangerous. </p>

<p>The number of clock cycles required to run a given instruction varies from 
  processor to processor; some processors take multiple cycles to execute instructions 
  that another processor might execute in even less than a full clock cycle. For 
  these and other reasons, clock speed is far from giving a complete idea of the 
  speed with which a processor can execute a program, even a CPU-intensive program.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Pentium, Intel processors feature a special
internal 64-bit register called the <b>timestamp counter</b>.  On
power-on, the value of this counter is zero.  Every clock cycle, the
processor increments the value in this counter by one.  Since it's a
64-bit register, 2<sup>64</sup> cycles can pass before the register
loops around to zero.  2<sup>64</sup> is 18,446,744,073,709,551,616.
Dividing this number by your current clock frequency yields how many
seconds it will take your computer to wrap around.  For example, at
exactly 2.0GHz, the processor will have to be on for 9223372037
seconds, or over 292 years.</p>

<p>When a preemptively multitasking operating system 
  like Windows schedules a process, it arranges to have a signal sent to the kernel 
  after a certain amount of time. On this signal, which is known as the <b>timer
  interrupt</b>, the kernel decides whether  
  to switch out the current thread, or leave the current thread running. This decision is
  made by the scheduling policy of the operating system, and can take into account various
  factors such as thread priority, the time a thread has spent processing, and the
  time other threads have spent waiting to process. The length of time between timer interrupts is
  known as the <b>timer interval</b>.  The timer interval is an important factor in the effectiveness of
  a preemptive multitasking operating system, since a timer interval that is too short will
  create a large amount of overhead and reduce overall system performance.  On the other hand,
  a timer interval that is too long will allow programs to run much longer without 
  interruption, thus reducing the illusion of many programs running simultaneously.
</p>

<p>Through the power of the timestamp counter, 
  it's possible to detect when the program has been preempted. As the first part 
  of this exercise, you will both determine the timer interval used by your operating 
  system and analyze data given to you to determine properties of your operating 
  system.</p>

<p>As the second part of this exercise, you will use threaded programming to implement 
  a simple client that efficiently retrieves information from multiple simulated 
  databases over a simulated network.</p>

<p>By the end of this lab, you should have a working understanding of
how an operating system implements the abstraction of concurrency on
a single CPU.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<h2>Part I:  The kernel timer interval</h2>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p><a href="Exercise6/handout/timestamp_v1.zip">Here</a> is one of the programs you will be using
for this section.  
The archive should contain the following files;
you will want to create a new directory to unzip them in.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Timestamp.dsw</dt>
    <dd>The Visual C++ Workspace for the project</dd>
  <dt>Timestamp.dsp</dt>
    <dd>The Visual C++ Project for this project</dd>
  <dt>Timestamp.opt</dt>
    <dd></dd>
  <dt>Timestamp.plg</dt>
    <dd></dd>
  <dt>Timestamp.ncb</dt>
    <dd></dd>
  <dt>Timestamp.exe</dt>
    <dd>A precompiled version of the code in this directory</dd>
  <dt>tsc.h</dt>
    
  <dd>An interface to code, which reads the timestamp counter</dd>
  <dt>tsc.c</dt>
    <dd>Assembly-language routines to read the timestamp counter</dd>
  <dt>test.cpp</dt>
    <dd>Contains function <code>main</code> and the routines for recording and reporting the timestamp information</dd>
</dl>

<p>Definitely take a look at <code><cite>test.cpp</cite></code>, specifically
  procedure <code>spin</code>.  Procedure <code>spin</code> contains a
  for-loop that, upon each iteration, reads and stores the value of the timestamp register.
  Actually, there are a few for-loops in function <code>spin</code>; the 
  for-loop that reads the timestamp register is labeled "Reading Timestamp".
  Run the precompiled executable and examine this source code to gain a good
  understanding of how this program operates.  As you examine the source code,
  particularly function <code>spin</code> and the labeled "Reading Timestamp"
  for-loop, ask yourself the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What is being stored in array <code>table</code>?</li>
<li>What size is array <code>table</code> initialized to?</li>
  <li>At its peak, how many different instances of array <code>table</code> will 
    be there when 4 threads are running?</li>
</ul>
  Do not spend a long time studying this source code. Just read through it to 
get an idea of how the program works. Note that the file <code><cite>Timestamp.exe</cite></code> 
is precompiled directly from the source in this archive. If you decide to recompile 
for some reason, make sure you're compiling for &quot;Release&quot; version (as 
opposed to the &quot;Debug&quot; version); the debugger adds strange latencies 
and inefficiencies to the code that can be difficult to analyze. 
<p></p>


<h3>The <code>Timestamp</code> program - How it works</h3>

<p>You can run the program from inside Visual C++, but you won't be able to specify 
  options or clearly read the output. Instead, you should start a command prompt, 
  change to the project directory, and run the program (Timestamp.exe) from there. 
  If you type "Timestamp -h", that will tell you about the options available to 
  you. 
<p> This program will create a user specified number of threads that each executes 
  a simple for-loop. For each execution of this for-loop, the value of the timestamp 
  register is read and stored into an array. Each thread stores these values into 
  a separate array. By examining the timestamp values in one of these arrays, 
  the program can determine when a specific thread was running (and when it wasn't 
  running). If a thread was running, that means it was executing the for-loop 
  and storing consecutive values into its array that differ by very little. These 
  values would differ only slightly simply because it does not take the processor 
  very long to complete a loop iteration. For our purposes, a difference of 1 
  to 200 or so cycles is considered normal for a loop iteration. A difference 
  between consecutive values in one of the thread arrays that is very large, say 
  20,000,000 cycles, means that the thread was not running during that timespan. 
  The values in all of the arrays (from all the threads) can be processed into 
  a timeline of when and for how long each thread in the program ran. We will 
  use the timestamp program to help generate this timeline. 
<p>The basic usage of this program is straightforward. The program fills a table 
  (an array named <code>table</code>) of a given size (this size can be set with 
  the '-i' option, as in, "Timestamp -i 5000") with readings from the timestamp 
  counter, one per iteration of the for-loop in procedure <code>spin</code>. After 
  the program finishes the for-loop, a report is generated of when it thinks the 
  thread was switched out. It does this by looking at the differences between 
  consecutive timestamps; anything that exceeds a given threshold is considered 
  a switch. By default, this threshold is the minimum -- that is, it is set to 
  the minimum number of cycles elapsed during one iteration of the loop in function 
  <code>spin</code>. Any difference between consecutive timestamps that is longer 
  than the minimum threshold the program views as an interrupt. Sometimes, for 
  various reasons, an iteration of the loop simply takes longer, and unfortunately 
  the timestamp program will incorrectly view these instances as interrupts. Using 
  the <code>-t</code> command-line option we can override the default minimum 
  threshold and manually set the threshold that the timestamp program will use. 
  Setting the threshold to a much higher value than the minimum will allow the 
  timestamp program to better depict real interrupts by ignoring the instances 
  where it just took the loop longer to execute. For example, on my 700Mhz machine 
  running Windows NT 4.0, a threshold value of 1000 cycles (as opposed to my minimum 
  calculated threshold of 42 cycles) will allow the timestamp program to only 
  report actual interrupts. A final option of the timestamp program that we will 
  use in this exercise is the ability to have the timestamp program create more 
  than one thread. Using the <code>-p</code> command-line option, we can specify 
  how many threads we would like to have continually reading the timestamp register. 
  The default for this option is 1, but that is not very interesting, so in practice, 
  we will set this option to usually around 4 or 5. </p>

<p>The results of this program are clearest when being executed on a
computer with very little else running.  Remember, the program picks
up on any context switch, not just those caused by timer interrupts.
Disk activity causes interrupts (to signal the end of specific
transfers) which can make the data much more confusing.</p>


<h3>The <code>graph</code> program - How it works</h3>

<p><a href="Exercise6/handout/graph.zip">Here</a> is the second program that you will use for this 
  section. This program will graphically depict the results of the Timestamp.exe 
  program. This file should contain the following files; you will want to create 
  a new directory to unzip them in.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>graph.exe</dt>
    
  <dd>The compiled version of the following source code files</dd>
  <dt>graph.vbp</dt>
    <dd>A Visual Basic 6.0 project file</dd>
  <dt>frmGraph.frm</dt>
    <dd>A Visual Basic 6.0 form file</dd>
  <dt>clsData.cls</dt>
    <dd>A Visual Basic 6.0 class module</dd>
  <dt>clsThread.cls</dt>
    <dd>A Visual Basic 6.0 class module</dd>
</dl>

<p>Feel free to browse the source code if you wish.  To use the graph program,
you will need the data generated from the timestamp program to be saved
in a file with a <code>.out</code> extension. Use redirection to do this. 
For example, the following line will redirect the output of the
timestamp program to a file named <code>output.out</code>: 

<p> <code>Timestamp.exe -t 1000 -i 1000000 -p 4 > output.out</code> 
<p>After saving the output of the timestamp program to a file, start
the graph program by double-clicking on the file from Explorer, or using the 
Start-Run menu command.  When you initially start the graph program you will 
see the following:

<p><img src="Exercise6/handout/graph1.jpg">

<p>Clicking on the <cite>Select Data File</cite> button will bring up 
a dialog where you can browse to a <code>.out</code> timestamp program
generated data file. After selecting a file, you will see (depending on
the data in the actual file) something like this:

<p><img src="Exercise6/handout/graph2.jpg">

<p>In the above screen shot of the graph program, we can easily see that
data from four threads is depicted, since each thread is color coded, and
we see four colors (green, blue, red, and cyan).  Also, in the default
viewing mode of the graph program each thread is depicted on a separate horizontal
line, with thread numbers on the left and right of the graph. The graph, which simply 
shows when each thread was running, reads from left
to right, so the green thread (thread 0) was the first thread to begin execution. The
green thread encountered two interrupts, denoted by the red tick marks.
Note that during the first interrupt the green thread was no longer running,
but that since the length of this interrupt was so short (and the resolution
of the monitor is limited), we see no visible gap in the display of the green thread execution.  For this reason, the 
red tick marks are included, otherwise it would be difficult to see these
very short times when the operating system code (and not the thread) is being run during the interrupt.  
During the second interrupt that occurs while the green thread is running,
the operating system switches execution
to the blue thread.  The green thread does not run again until after the
other three threads each run.  To get a more linear view of the four
threads, check the <cite>Single Line</cite> check box at the bottom
of the interface.  Something similar to this will result:

<p><img src="Exercise6/handout/graph3.jpg">

<h3>Finding the timer interval</h3>

<p>Looking at the linear view of the threads in the screen shot above, we can 
see that most of the interrupts (the red ticks) are occurring at a regular
interval.  It is probably the case that these are timer interrupts.
We can get a good guess at the timer interval by finding the difference
between when these interrupts occur.  To do this, hover your mouse
pointer above an interrupt.  A message will appear that gives information
about the interrupt, namely, when the interrupt occurred and how long 
it lasted.  By subtracting the starting points of two suspected timer
interrupts, we can get a multiple of the timer interval.  If these are
two adjacent interrupts, then our result is the timer interval, and not
a multiple of the timer interval.  Performing this on the graph listed above,
I got an estimate of 6,988,500 for my timer interval.

We can test this hypothesis by overlaying our guess of the timer interval
onto the graph.  To do this, click the <cite>Overlay</cite> button.  This
option will first ask us to select an interrupt that we believe is a timer
interrupt.  Using the mouse, we point to any one of the several interrupts
we believe is a timer interrupt.  After clicking on an interrupt, we are
then asked to input our calculated estimate of the timer interval.  After
typing in 6,988,500 the program then displays the following:

<p><img src="Exercise6/handout/graph4.jpg">

<p>It is important to understand what the program did for us. The program drew 
  the dashed gray lines at an interval of every 6,988,500 cycles (our guess of 
  the interval), from the starting point of the interrupt (the red tick) that 
  we picked. If we had picked an interrupt that was not a timer interrupt, the 
  overlaid dashed gray lines would not match up to very many (if any) other interrupts.</p>  

If the timer interval is correct, and a timer interrupt is indeed picked as the 
starting point for the overlay, the overlaid dashed gray lines will match timer 
interrupts in <strong>all</strong> threads, not just one or two. If your overlaid 
estimate seems to match interrupts for only one thread and not the others, then 
your interrupts are not timer interrupts. In this case, you may have to increase 
the threshold (with the <code>-t</code> option) from the timestamp program, since 
you may be viewing periodic events (but not interrupts) in the course of the execution 
of a specific thread. Remember, timer interrupts are hardware generated and are 
periodic across all threads. This means that a timer interrupt will always occur 
every so many cycles (or seconds), and also, this period never shifts. In the 
screen shot listed above, we can easily see that our guess of the timer interval 
and our choice of an interrupt were correct, since our overlaid guess matches 
the periodic interrupts in all threads. Also, timestamp data (not shown here) 
with much smaller thresholds did not show any shorter periodic interrupts. 
<p>Now we can also see some other interesting facts. For instance, notice that 
  the right most full timer interval contains none of our four threads. What happened 
  here? Put simply enough, the operating system scheduled another process. After 
  that process ran one full time interval, the OS switched back to the one of 
  our four threads (thread 3, the cyan one), which needed only a very short time 
  to complete execution. Something else that is interesting is the presence of 
  non-timer interrupts. We see a few here. What are these? Most likely the first 
  (which is the 5th re-tick from left) is an I/O interrupt, but the final two 
  (the last two red-ticks on the right) actually are the green and blue threads 
  completing execution before the end of a timer interval. During these interrupts, 
  the operating system has to decide what to schedule next. In the case of the 
  green thread finishing, the blue thread (thread 1) was scheduled next. 
<p>You will also need to know the approximate clock speed of your processor, since, 
  to determine the timer interval in seconds, the length of the timer interval 
  in cycles must be divided by the number of clock cycles the processor receives 
  in one second. Make sure to remember the relationship between cycles and Hertz 
  (Hz). Hertz is a measurement of cycles per second. So a 200MHz processor, by 
  definition of Hertz (Hz), receives 200000000 (200 million) clock cycles in one 
  second. Likewise, a 2GHz processor can safely receive 2000000000 (2 billion) 
  clock cycles in one second. To get an estimate of the clock rate of your machine, 
  execute the following: <tt>Timestamp -s</tt>. The program will determine how 
  long it takes (in milliseconds and cycles) to execute a series of instructions. 
  From this data it will output an estimate of the clock rate of your processor. 
<p>Also, typical timer intervals range
  between 1 and 10 milliseconds.  So if you know your processor's clock rate, you can
  get an idea of what range to look in for your timer interval.  For example, my processor is
  rated to receive 700 million cycles per second.  So my timer interval should be between
  700,000 and 7,000,000 cycles.  This may seem like a large range of values, but in reality, 7,000,000
  cycles go by very quickly (actually in 10ms on my 700Mhz machine).
</p>


<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>For this part of the exercise, run the timestamp program with 4 threads 
(the <code>-p 4</code> command-line option) executing.  
Save the output to a file named <code>output.out</code>.  Then,
open this data file with the graph program and answer the following
questions.    You may have to run the timestamp program many times,
with different options for the threshold and number of iterations to get
data that clearly depicts the timer interval.  If your machine
is faster than 700Mhz, you may need to increase the number of iterations
and/or decrease the threshold.  For the record, the
command line used on my 700Mhz machine to generate the data that the graph
program screen shots display was as follows:</p>

<p> <code>Timestamp -t 1000 -i 1000000 -p 4 > output.out</code> </p>

<p>
Hand in your answers to these questions in a file named <code><cite>answers.txt</cite></code>.  <strong>Also, make
sure you submit the <code><cite>output.out</cite></code> file that you based the
answers to the questions on.

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>In this part of the lab, you're going to use threads to parallelize the
operation of a very simple database client.  This program has a very simple
task:  you provide it an account number, and it prints out the personal
and account information of the client corresponding to that number.</p>

<p>The business for which you're writing this application has decided to
split the account information into two separate databases: one to
manage client's personal information (which is bulky, but mostly
constant), and one to manage the client's account information (which
is smaller, but changes a lot).  The job of the program is to contact
each database, access the information, and print it to the user.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the databases are slow, and your connection to them
isn't good.  It can, therefore, take awhile to contact each database,
so in order to make the program respond as quickly as possible, you
have decided to use threaded programming, so that separate threads
can contact the databases in parallel.</p>

<p>Your program should work as follows:</p>

<ol><li>The main thread retrieves the account number from the command
	line.</li>
    <li>The main thread creates two threads to access the
        databases and gives them the account number requested.</li>
    <li>The database threads contact the databases and get the
	results.  When they have the results, they pass them to

    <li>The main thread waits for the database threads to terminate,

</ol>

<p>When compiling this program, you may occasionally receive a linker warning 
  about conflicts with LIBC. You may safely ignore this warning.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An existing codebase exists which contacts each database
sequentially and retrieves information from them.  You should modify
this program to use threads, but otherwise leave it alone -- the
output should be in the same style, etc.</p>

<p>The code for contacting the databases is already written for you, in
the two functions <code>GetPersonalInformation()</code> and
<code>GetAccountInformation()</code>.  These functions simulate contacting
a real database server over a slow network connection.  Your worker
threads should simply call these functions.</p>

<p>To create a thread, use the <code>_beginthread()</code> Windows API
call:</p>

<p><code>unsigned long _beginthread( void (*startpoint)( void * ), unsigned int stacksize, void *arguments )</code></p>

<p>The first argument is a pointer to the function that Windows will call at the 
  beginning of the thread; when this function returns, the thread will terminate. 
  This function takes a <code>void *</code> as an argument, and "returns" <code>void</code>; 
  be sure to specify that it uses __cdecl calling conventions (see example). The 
  stack size you should provide is 0; Windows interprets this as a special case 
  meaning "inherit the stack size from the parent thread", which is fine for our 
  purposes. The third argument is the argument that will be provided to the thread's 
  main function. For example, if you declare:</p>

<code><pre>
 /* our thread's starting function; be sure to explicitly
    use __cdecl calling conventions */
 void __cdecl threadfunc( void *args ) {
    int *n = (int *) args;
    cout << "Received %d\n" << *n << endl;
}

int main( int argc, char **argv ) {
    HANDLE thread;
    int n = 7;
    thread = (HANDLE) _beginthread( threadfunc, 0, &n );
    if (thread == (HANDLE) -1L) {
	cerr << "Couldn't create thread!" << endl;
	exit(1);
    }else {
 	WaitForSingleObject( thread, INFINITE );
	cout << "Done!" << endl;
	exit(0);
    }
}
</pre></code>

<p><code>_beginthread</code> is prototyped to return an unsigned long.
In fact, this unsigned long is equivalent to a <b>handle</b>, which is
a Windows-specific abstraction.  A handle represents some sort of
operating-system object, like synchronization primitives and opened
files; in this case, it's a <b>thread handle</b>.  We can do all sorts
of interesting things to threads using a thread handle, but here we
just want to wait for the thread to end; we can achieve that using the
<code>WaitForSingleObject</code> call.  In the project, you'll want to
wait for any of several handles; this is done using the
<code>WaitForMultipleObjects</code> call:</p>

<p><code>DWORD WaitForMultipleObjects( DWORD count, CONST HANDLE *handles, BOOL wait_all, DWORD timeout )</code></p>

<p><code>handles</code> points to an array of handles that you're
interested in; the number of elements in the array must be (at least)
<code>count</code>.  If <code>wait_all</code> is <code>TRUE</code>,
then <code>WaitForMultipleObjects</code> will wait for all of the
handles to become signalled -- if they're thread handles, for all the
threads to terminate.  <code>timeout</code> specifies how long to
wait, in milliseconds; the special value <code>INFINITE</code> means
to wait for all the handles, no matter how long it takes.</p>

<p>You should always check your calls for completion.  In particular,
<code> _beginthread()</code> can return -1L to signal that it failed to
create a thread.  If you make any assumptions in your code, be sure
to state them clearly.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>You will be graded on this part of the assignment as follows:</p>
